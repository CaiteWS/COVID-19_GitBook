# 4.1 Transfer Policy

Data will be uploaded to the COVID-19 repository through CKAN's [FileStore](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/maintaining/filestore.html) feature. This feature allows deposits through CKAN's API features and the depositor will receive an authentication code once the upload has been approved. This CNAN feature allows scanning the deposit for viruses and other standardization procedures.

If CKAN's FileStore feature is not applicable to the dataset being uploaded, we will work with the depositor to find a solution on an as-needed basis.

Since this repository deals with medical data, all personal identifying information will be scrubbed from the deposit before uploading to the repository including names, addresses, contact information. 

Upon upload, each dataset will receive a unique identifier in the form of a digital object identifier \(DOI\). The DOI and confirmation of successful upload will be emailed to the depositor to confirm receipt. The DOI will be represented by the [dct:identifier](https://udfr.org/docs/onto/dct_identifier.html) metadata element.
