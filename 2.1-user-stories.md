# 2.1 User Stories

**Potential Users:**

In thinking about potential users for our COVID-19 data protocol, we narrowed in on three main groups: 

* Data Curators

  * We imagined that many data curators are interested in combining COVID-19 data from multiple areas and might use our protocol as a template

* General Public

  * Educational administrators trying to make decisions about how to bring back students in the fall
  * Citizens generally curious about COVID-19 data

* Academics and Researchers

  * Many research teams are investigating COVID-19 right now and could use this protocol to share and investigate data
  * Academics investigating and learning about COVID-19 could use this protocol as a way to synthesize information
