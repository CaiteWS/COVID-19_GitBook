# 4.2 Transformation Policy

We will store and display the data in CSV files, which are easy to modify and interpret. We will accept proprietary data that are owned by cities, which would allow us to maximize the amount of data we can collect or freely available data. To ensure this rule is followed, we will add a field in the submission document which asks for the proprietary information and prevent submission if the field does not have “N/A” or the information for a city. While our metadata schema includes a “Modified” field, we will also add simple versioning to the title of each updated table \(v1.0 to v2.0\) to ensure every user knows we are continually updating the data.

To integrate all the data tables, we will perform standardization and transformation in accordance with tidy data principles. Beginning with a data dictionary that covers each variable and defines the standards for them \(such as transforming each date into YYYY/MM/DD\), then deciding the best level of specificity \(such as normalizing all ZIP codes to five digits instead of nine\).
