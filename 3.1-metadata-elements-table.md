# 3.1 Metadata Elements Table

We began by thinking about the what metadata would be important for the three groups of stakeholders: Data Curators, General Public, and Academics and Researchers. We decided to focus on being able to find the most current information easily, using some of the Dublin Core terms suggested by World Wide Web Consortium \(W3C\). They are broadly applicable, so curators can integrate data across cities without issue. The general public would be able to find and download the different datasets easily using this schema. Academics and researchers could use our schema to combine and share their datasets.

We would recommend using JSON for encoding this data.
