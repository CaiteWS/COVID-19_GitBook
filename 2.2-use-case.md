# 2.2 Use Case

Our data consists of CSV files from multiple cities that publish their COVID-19 data in an open format.  We explored data from multiple locations: Cincinnati, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Buffalo, San Francisco, Boulder, Washtenaw County \(MI\), Cumberland County \(NC\), State of Hawaii, State of Virginia, Seattle, Austin, and Chicago. While all of these municipalities, states, and counties offered helpful data visualizations, only Austin, Chicago, and Virginia make their data public and downloadable. Virginia, in particular, offered robust datasets.

In developing the Use Case for our repository, we relied on the 2.16 Open City Data Pipeline template from WC3: [https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp-ucr/\#UC-OpenCityDataPipeline](https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp-ucr/#UC-OpenCityDataPipeline)

_Domains served by the data:_ Socrata and ArcGIS Hub open-source 

_Motivation for publishing the data:_ Public Health 

_Potential ways that the domains will use the data:_ public health tracking and analysis 

_Quality:_ comparison between cities 

_Lineage \(provenance\):_  from open access municipal data

_Size:_ Variable

_Format:_ CSV

_Rate of Change:_ frequent

_Lifespan:_ archived in repository

_Potential audiences:_ the general public, researchers, public health officers

_Positive aspects of the published data:_ most open data are on the same platform

_Negative aspects of the published data:_ multiple platforms, diverse metadata elements, varied updates

**Requirements for DWBP**: 

**1\) R-AccessBulk** and **R-AccessLevel:** _The data should be open-source and downloadable from the web._ 

**2\) R-AccessUpToDate:** _Data should be updated frequently in accordance with a published schedule._ 

**3\) R-MetadataDocum:** _If metadata is not standardized it should be well documented._

**4\) R-SensitivePrivacy:** _Data should not infringe on right to privacy. \(medical information\)_

**Other emphases:** 

* Constancy
* Easy to find the most recent information
* Conducive to the analysis of data from multiple municipalities
* Conducive to the safety of curators during a pandemic
