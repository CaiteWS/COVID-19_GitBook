# 2.2 Use Case

Our data consists of CSV files from multiple cities that publish their COVID-19 data in an open format.  We explored data from multiple locations: Cincinnati, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Buffalo, San Francisco, Boulder, Washtenaw County \(MI\), Cumberland County \(NC\), State of Hawaii, State of Virginia, Seattle, Austin, and Chicago. While all of these municipalities, states, and counties offered helpful data visualizations, only Austin, Chicago, and Virginia makes their data public and downloadable. Virginia, in particular, offered robust datasets.
