# 5 Concluding Notes

We discovered numerous challenges to standardizing municipal, county, and state COVID-19 data in establishing this protocol. Differing platforms \(ArcGIS and Socrata\) and varying metadata schemes were challenging, but the biggest hindrance was many cities not allowing access to raw or CVS versions of their data. 

Since the U.S. Coronavirus fight has been localized into a bottom-up approach, it would be helpful to develop a universal scheme to combine data and assist Public Health officials, epidemiologists, doctors, researchers, and the general public in locating trends, hotspots, and insights to quell the virus. Our hope this repository is a small step in that direction.
